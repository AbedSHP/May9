- May9 Workspaces do not autosave, so is needed manually save the workspace changes


Exclusive script
- da_intPlay: this script add the interactive play button directly to Time Slider
- da_curveToPoly: this script make possible the conversion of curves in polygons
- da_interactiveBooleans: this script make the Polygonal Boolean process more interactive
- da_BooleanFullIntersect: this script make a full intersect, so this execute a mesh subtraction but maintain subtracted part as separate object
- da_PlaneCutter: this script cut a mesh by using a flat mesh, this can be useful for simulate surface cracks
- da_AutoBevel: this script analyse the angle between faces and try to add a Bevel node only on needed edges
- da_ClothAsDeformer: this script set up the current mesh to be deformed by nCloth solver, this can be useful for simulate character selfcollision skin or muscle dynamics
- da_nParticleConverter: this script add the ability to convert particle to a specific type after their creation
- da_perspToggle: this script convert the current persp view to the closest ortho, and vice versa
- da_shell: this script emulates Shell deformer of Autodesk 3D Studio Max, by adding a thickness to flat polygons
- da_ConvertToMetaballs: this script convert particles to polygonal Metaballs
- da_MashVoxelizer: this script use MASH to voxelize an arbitrary mesh inside of another mesh
- da_RivetMash: this script constraint the pivot of a polygon to a component of another polygon
- da_CurveDistributionMash: this script scatter and constrain a polygonal object along a curve
- da_EdgeToLoopToCurve: this script convert edge selection to loop and then make a batch conversion to curves, this is useful for converting polygonal hair to curve hair
- da_SurfaceScatterMash: this script scatter and constrain a polygonal object on a mesh
- da_CurveLength: this script returns the length of a curve in Maya unit
- da_MouseTrack: this script tracks the mouse movement and create an animation
- da_FacesFollicles: this script creates a follicle in the centre of selected faces
- da_Compass: this script converts Euler angle into a XYZ vector, for drive wind direction in Nucleus and Air Filed
- da_CombineCurves: this script combines curves in a single transform
- da_SepareCurves: this script separate combined curves


Version 3.0 highlight
- Plugin structure, work over existing configuration
- Removed almost all custom preferences
- Overral improvements
